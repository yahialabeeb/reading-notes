## In HTML we have many possible ways to list things 
1. Ordered lists  (Numbered lists)
when the programer want to list each item on the list

1. Unordered lists (bullet lists)
when the programer did not want to numbered the items

1. Definition lists
when we need to add a definition for items 
1. Nested lists 
the lists in side list 

### syantex examples
* ordered list
(<ol>
<li>apple</li>
<li>orange</li>
<li>banana</li>
</ol>

* unordred 
<ul>
<li>apple</li>
<li>orange</li>
<li>banana</li>
</ul>
