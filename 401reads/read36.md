# Whiteboard Advice

## The Advice: Communicate!

## What Do You Mean Communicate?
* Even if you think you understand the problem, you should take some very important steps before moving forward.

## First, Restate the Question
Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for.

## Ask About Edge Cases

Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up.


## Ask About Test Cases

This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. 





## Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later
1. in the worst case the interviewer will tell you to continue without actually offering feedback.
2. In the best case, the interviewer might actually point out logical flaws in your pseudocode that will give you some serious benefit when transitioning to actual code.

## Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
* (Finally Start Writing Code)


You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in.
## Stuck? Ask for Help!
If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally.

# 7 tips to ace a programming interview

## 1) Take a few minutes.
* Wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Ask any clarifying questions
* then tell your interviewer:
“Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”
* Think through the basics of the problem, and decide on an approach.
* Then re-engage the interviewer, and let him know what you’ve concluded. Don’t forget to provide your reasoning!
## 2) Write down the steps of the solution.
Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.
## 3) Write pseudocode first.
Time to write code? Nope. Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode. 

No worrying about off-by-one issues, or index arithmetic; just verifying that our logic is correct.

## 4) Don’t sweat the small stuff.
They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. 
## 5) Sit down. Be humble.
A programming is an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess. For example:
1. Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
2. Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
3. How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
4. Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
5. Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
6. Are you honest (especially about yourself)?

6) Come prepared.
It’s important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards. In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success.

7) Review your work.
* Think about how silly you look if your solution is not right.
* review your code as you would in a peer review. 
* Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted.
