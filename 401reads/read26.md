# Intro to Django

## Object-relational mapper
* Deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.

## URLs and views
1. Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.

2. A Python module called URLconf is like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.

## Templates
* Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable those used to working with HTML, but it is also flexible and highly extensible,

## Forms 
* Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML

## Authentication
* Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions.

## Admin
One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site.

## Internationalization
Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones.

## Security
### Django provides multiple protections against:

* Clickjacking
* Cross-site scripting
* Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* SQL injection
* Remote code execution

## Django
* a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers 

* open source, meaning the code is available for free 

## Django Software Foundation

* The DSF supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities. 
* The Django Fellows do incredible, behind-the-scenes work for the community
* The DSF also supports projects related to Django such as the Kickstarters for Django REST Framework 3, improved PostgreSQL support, among others
* If you make a donation to Django–and if you’re using Django professionally you really should–that money goes to the DSF. 

## Technical Organization
* The DSF handles legal, financial, and administrative matters for Django. But there is a separate organizational structure for the technical team.


* Django has a small, core team of trusted volunteers who work alongside the Django Fellows to manage technical side of the Django Project.
* Django Core members are divided into teams that have authority over the Django Project infrastructure, including the Django Project website itself, the official issue tracker, official mailing lists, IRC channels, and more.

## Conclusion
* Django’s code is open source and available to all.
* Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. 
* Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.
