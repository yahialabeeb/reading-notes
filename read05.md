# Images
## Adding Images
### Img tag
To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element.
it is a self closing (there is no closing tag). It must carry the 
following two attributes:

### scr 
This tells the browser where image file is.

### alt
This provides a text describes the image when you cannot see it.

## Other attributes
### Title
You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element 
to provide additional information about the image.

### Height
This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
### Width
This specifies the width of the image in pixel.

## Rules for Creating Images

## Important Notes from Duckett
 
 > * You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image. 
 > * You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
 > * Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
