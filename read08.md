# Controlling the Position

## HTML element own box
* block-level
* box or an inline box
## positioning schemes to control the layout of a page
### Normal flow.
* Each block-level element sits on top of the next one.
* The syntax would be position: static; 
* It stretches the width of the entire browser window by default. 
### Relative positioning.
* Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
* The syntax would be position:relative
* The values of the box offset properties are usually given in pixels, percentages or ems. 

### Absolute positioning.

* When the position property is given a value of absolute,the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.

* By default, most browsers add a margin to the top of the <h1>element.
