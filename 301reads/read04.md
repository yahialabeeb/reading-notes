# React Forms

## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input.

## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

when they enter them, that makes webpage more active.

## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

### For one.

event.target.value
### For more than one

event.target.nameOfEvent.value

# The Conditional (Ternary)

## Why would we use a ternary operator?

because This shorter code yields us the same result of the long one 

## Rewrite 
console.log(x===y ? true : false);
